I did not add helper functions or modify any of the existing code except for where denoted by "Please Fill Missing Lines Here". 

I imported the numpy library to help implement parts of the assignment in KMeans.py and DataPoints.py. 

I've included 2 additional python scripts under /extras, they are:
- precision.py: used to compute precision in problem 1.
- nmi.py: used to compute nmi in problem 1, I wrote this at first and later used sklearn's sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score() function to compare results. They were identical.
